gtk-sharp-samples
=================

About
-----
This repo contains working samples of code I create while I work with the gtk-sharp library on my own projects. Because of this, the samples contained in this repo will not be as comprehensive as they could be. 

Iâ€™m sharing this code because I have noticed that sometimes simple working examples can be hard to find for gtk-sharp. 

So far all of these samples were created using MonoDevelop.
